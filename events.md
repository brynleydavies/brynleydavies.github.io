##Rights to brand a prestigious challenge event

Service Course Sport has developed a challenge event with a difference as it is not open to the general public and has a maximum invite list of 30 riders. You can acquire the rights to brand this event as your own for a set period of time (with option to extend). Together we would market the event, potentially pulling in interested sponsors that fit with your values, and use it as a vehicle to deliver brand promotion for your company and as a platform to activate stronger engagement with customers, staff, introducers, charities, even the general public and be firmly associated with a prestigious cycling challenge amongst your industry peers.

##Unique events designed to fit your requirements

The other option would be for us to sit down with you to discuss what you want out of the event (your return on investment) and we would design it from scratch for anywhere in the world. We will design a full challenge event including routes, luxury accommodation, entertainment and brand it for a corporate business who want something different to bond team members and network far more effectively with their customers and introducers on the bike than on the golf course â€“ a memorable achievement which can tie in with raising funds for your corporate charity. We will act as ride guides and bring in famous guest speakers for dinner.

##Bespoke fundraising challenges

Same as above but designed specifically with a charity angle in mind. Either a charity close to your business, or a charity known to Service Course Sport which is looking for an event to benefit from.

##Example events

For example we have created a London to Brighton two day event with winetasting and clubbing for staff at a global law firm and at the other end of the spectrum designed a 4 day challenge for Senior Partners and their customers in the highlands of Scotland which is time they would never get to spend together and in tough physical and mental circumstances which has strengthened their client relationship like no other event or function has ever done.
