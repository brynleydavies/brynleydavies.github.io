A 5 star luxury 11th century farmhouse in a relaxing, rural location far away from busy Pollensa, at the foot of the Coll de sa Batalla climb. It has a large swimming pool and plenty of relaxation areas.

There is a service course for bike build, mechanical maintenance, rider briefings and roller training sessions.

We have 5 course dinner, fulsome breakfasts and healthy lunches using menus recommended by your coaches in advance of your stay. Local produce that provides you with real, natural and healthy food to boost your energy levels and support your immune function.

Laundry will be provided.

We love this place and the local roads that we use for our split session coaching days.
