We believe you gain an advantage in building genuine customer relationships and therefore improved return on marketing/hospitality spend by partnering with Service Course Sport to create a coached cycling challenge which takes people out of their comfort zones like no other networking opportunity can.

You build stronger relationships with customers and forge tighter teams in the face of adversity – we design cycling challenges to bring the best out of riders with this in mind. But don’t just take our word for it

<blockquote>The friend in my adversity I shall always cherish most. I can better trust those who helped to relieve the gloom of my dark hours than those who are so ready to enjoy with me the sunshine of my prosperity.

We come up with concepts from scratch, bring in product partners/guest speakers, and allow you to market the event to your customers and publicise within your industry press. Our events and training packages act as great stories to drive social media engagement, brand promotion and can be used in conjunction with supporting your business’ chosen charity.

Our initial clients and contacts come from the London corporate and professional financial services market, including solicitors, banks, private equity and accountancy firms. We would love to work with businesses from other industry sectors, including charity organisations with a view to building wider networking opportunities for them.

Our focus is absolutely on delivering a return on investment which surpasses your expectations, through strengthening customer relationships, motivating staff, and driving brand awareness. See corporate services for more detail.
