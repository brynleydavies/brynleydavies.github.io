##Bespoke Challenge

We will design training camps that meet the requirements of your corporate challenge brief. We will match the event and locale characteristics and rider’s physical and technical needs to the challenge you have all signed up to, eg. mountain training camps in the Pyrenees, endurance training in Mallorca, Sportive specific in the Sussex Hills, Lake District and Scottish Highlands. Check our case study for a recent example.

##Client Engagement / Team Build

When you want to get to know much better a select group of customers or create a fantastic team building exercise with a few days to a week on the bikes in the sun, we can set something up for your business which encourages hard work, fun and lots of personal time together. You may have a preferred location in mind, we will build the camp to your brief.

##Alumni

Several of our clients have asked for 3 to 5 day camps bringing together individuals from different companies who we have previously worked with on various corporate assignments in order that they enjoy hard training sessions while incorporating excellent networking time with peers in their industry, on the bike and afterwards relaxing at our Mallorcan base.

##Performance

Based in Mallorca these camps are 1st come 1st served. British Cycling model, performance coaching camps designed for riders who want to advance their technique and abilities – they are not holidays with long café stops. Expect huge amounts of climbing and speed work, coach-led race scenarios and video analysis feedback. See the Training Sessions box for more detail.
