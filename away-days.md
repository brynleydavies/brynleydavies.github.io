##Closed circuit group coaching session ahead of Sportive challenge
Round up your staff or customers and introducers who can ride a bike and we will provide an exciting day of British Cycling Performance coaching sessions on a closed road circuit, for example at Redbridge Cycling Centre, Ilford or Cyclopark, Kent.

We will hire out the circuit and coach several sessions applicable to your needs, for example descending and cornering technique, improving confidence with group riding and chain gang through and off, sprinting technique, team time trials and we will employ coach-led racing scenarios to examine race tactics and strategies. We can film sessions using dartfish video analysis allowing for detailed visual feedback with the coaches on video playback at the end of each session exactly like what we do in the British Cycling Olympic Programme.

We would recommend following this training up with a local sportive soon after for them to feel the benefit of their training and provide the ‘competitive’ goal – something we could arrange and ride with you in support. A celebratory dinner with guest speaker afterwards to round off a few days of hard work and stronger relationships borne out of the challenging experience.

##Velodrome track training / networking on the boards
Everyone has watched Sir Chris Hoy and Vicky Pendleton compete at the Olympics and thought I wish I could try that – we can organise everything for you as a corporate day out at the track, London, Manchester, Newport or Glasgow and have you at the top of the banking by the end of the day even for complete novices.

We will take you through the actual track accreditation process which means that you will be fully proficient by the time you leave us and if you get the bug then you will be approved to race on the boards! As with the closed road circuit we can use the dartfish video analysis allowing for detailed visual feedback with the coaches on video playback at the end of each session exactly like what we do in the British Cycling Olympic Programme.

Then celebrate with dinner afterwards and enjoy the awards ceremony that we will compere based on the days’ performances!
